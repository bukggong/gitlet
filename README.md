# gitlet
A slightly less comprehensive version of a working Git directory written in Java, named Gitlet.
The project involves creating a version control system which mimics some of the basic features of Git, as well as some additional features. 
The features implemented are init, add, commit, rm, log, global-log, find, status, checkout, branch, rm-branch, reset, and merge.
